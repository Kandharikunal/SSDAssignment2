# Assignment 2

I have created 3 html page website using External `CSS(with class selector)` & `JavaScript(JQuery)` describing about myself.

## Brief about Website
It is a 3 page website consist of `Home, About me & Project` pages.

`Index.html` is the first page of this website.

`Home` This page just containg my picture and a welcome message
`About me` this page contains my pictures and a brief introduction about myself.
`Project` this page describes about my work experience and projects.

All page contains a common `Navigation bar` which can  be used to move to different pages of website.

`Note: on Page 3 you need to click on Work Experience & Project bars to see its content, same message is being displayed on hovering mouse cursor to them. and further need to be clicked on projects to see their content. On reclicking on them they will collapse.`

All the pages are created using the valid HTML tags and same are verified using the `validator.w3.org` validator.

## CSS 
All CSS is applied through the class selector with a seperate  CSS file `style.css`

## JavaScript 
All JavaScript is applied through using the `JQuery` with a seperate  JavaScript file `script.js`
