          I am Kunal Kandhari, I'm a freshman studying Computer Science and
          Information Security from International Institute of Information
          Technology, Hyderabad.<br /><br />
          I am a software developer having a 1.25 years of working experience in
          Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), worked on the technologies JAVA,
          Spring-Boot, Junit and Cucumber where I earned the
          <b>“On The Spot Award“</b> in 2020 for being an inspiring role model
          to my colleagues and an <b>“Appreciation Award“</b> in 2020 for
          completing the project in the very short duration of time.
          <br /><br />I graduated from the Indore Institute of Science and
          Technology in 2019 with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, while
          in college, I won 3 <b>“Line Follower Competition”</b> events in 2017
          which was held in the different colleges of Indore at inter-college
          level.<br /><br />
          I am obsessed with all things tech-related and I spend my free time
          building computers and developing my own software. In my free time I
          like to play cricket and learn some new skills, some of the skills
          which I have developed in my free time are <b>Investing</b> as just
          earning money is not enough, you need to make your money work hard for
          you as well. And some of my hobbies are drawing, photo editing, moody
          writer and last but not least I love making memes.
